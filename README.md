Standardized categorical data (Item_Fat_Content)

Explored numerical and categorical features with visualizations

Encoded categorical features using Label Encoding

Trained and tuned an XGBoost regression model

Evaluated model performance using R² score

Technologies Used

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Seaborn, Matplotlib

Scikit-learn

XGBoost

How to Use

Open the notebook Big_Mart_Sales_Prediction.ipynb in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook

Run the cells sequentially to see the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation

Modify hyperparameters or features to experiment with the model

Outcome

A working machine learning model that predicts sales and demonstrates practical data science workflow for beginners.
